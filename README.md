# Introduction

My main objective for this repository is to help CCPROG1 takers have more exercises for them to practice. I will share some of the exercises, my answers, and answer keys given to us while I was taking CCPROG1 in this repository. I hope this helps you pass CCPROG1.

# How to use this repository

As mentioned by our CCPROG1 professor, try not to look at the answer key as much as possible. Solve it on your own unless you are stuck. Try to understand the logic behind it rather than memorizing the code. Based on my experience, it's hard to come up with your solution at first, but trust me, it gets easier as you keep practicing. It's all about persistence and patience to solve a problem. Good luck!

I rated each of the problems in terms of (easiest) 🌚🌘🌗🌖🌓🌝 (hardest), so you will know what type of problem you're dealing with.
